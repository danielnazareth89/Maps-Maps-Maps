This widget uses a Google Earth kmz file to overlay timezones of the earth onto a Ext JS map enabling to check the timezone a marker is in simply by clicking on the zone.In fact this kind of overlay opens up the possibilities of dozens of different overlays using various existing kmz files.I have also used similar KMZ files for shipping and earthquake overlays.Some care must sometimes be taken so that the KMZ file renders correctly for a given application.
