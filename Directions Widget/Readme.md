This widget takes an origin, destinatiion and travel method as input and overlays visual and textual directions on top of the Ext JS Google Map panel.
As can be seen in the code, a call is made to the Google Map Directions API in the background. You can view this in action [here](http://jsfiddle.net/danielnazareth89/htf6rs1y/)
