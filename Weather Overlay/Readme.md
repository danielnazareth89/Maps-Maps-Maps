This widget locates a particular area using the Google Map geocoding API and then makes a call to the Open Weather Map API to obtain a weather forecast 
at that particular region. The widget listens for the idle event and updates when the map is dragged,zoomed in or out. It is built borrowing heavily from a project by github user __jpatokal__ viewable [here](https://github.com/google/maps-for-work-samples/blob/master/samples/OpenWeatherMapLayer/OpenWeatherMapLayer.pdf).It is possible to find a weather forecast for even the smallest cities/towns just by zooming in.You can also view a working jsfiddle [here](http://jsfiddle.net/danielnazareth89/ye5hbxza/)
